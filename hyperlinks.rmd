To accomplish our stated goal, we obtained restaurant health records from King Countyâ€™s Food Establishment Inspection dataset,
<a href= "https://data.kingcounty.gov/Health-Wellness/Food-Establishment-Inspection-Data/f29f-zza5"> dataset</a>
King County contains Seattle.
We then compared these food safety records with public perception data. We get these data from Zomato, an aggregator of restaurant review and user-generated information, which functions similarly to Yelp and Google Maps.
